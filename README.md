This is a webapp i made for the technical test for Mapersive

  To preview and run the project on your device:
  1) Open project folder in cmd/powershell
   Note: Please ensure you have installed <code><a href="https://nodejs.org/en/download/">nodejs</a></code>
  2) In the terminal, run `npm install`
  3) Run `npm start` to view project in browser
  4) Enjoy the Application

NB: i Had lots of creative ideas that i wanted to apply but i couldn't just freely go past your design;
My integration is pretty basic as well since i didn't have much directions.
